Imagine themselves in that position needing to come up with the strategy; so the next section makes more sense

1) box selected at random (e.g. different boxes are highlighted in turn and after a few seconds one remains highlighted---that's the selected box), (2) prompt prediction of ball color before seeing contents, and then (3) revealing the contents?

### Prediction and strategies

Frequency tables and strategies - employ that strategy repeatedly i.e. 100 times

### Confusion tables

Frequency table determines probabilities
Confusion tables record display the relationships between the most important probabilities
